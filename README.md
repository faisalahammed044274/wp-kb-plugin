🧩 1. Internal Support Documentation
Use it to document:

Troubleshooting procedures (e.g., “Fixing 403 errors in NGINX”)

Server management SOPs (e.g., “Restarting PHP-FPM in Ubuntu”)

Plugin or theme bugs you've fixed before

Hosting config quirks (e.g., DNS propagation delays)

👉 Think: A private wiki for your own dev or support team.

🧩 2. Customer Self-Service Help Center
Empower your users to solve problems before they contact you:

Common error fixes (e.g., “WooCommerce checkout not working”)

How-tos (e.g., “How to change your password”)

General FAQs

Multilingual content for global visitors

👉 Think: A hosted alternative to Zendesk or Intercom articles, but fully under your control.
